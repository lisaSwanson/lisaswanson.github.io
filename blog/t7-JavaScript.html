    <h2 id="#">Ruby vs JavaScript Differences</h2>
    <h4>June 14, 2015</h4>
    <p>
      Ruby as a first language has been a mental triathlon having to learn all the “built in” classes and methods.  Javascript, at first blush, seems more straight forward…less “reading between the lines” but that just means typing more lines of code to get your job done.  As I start learning both of these programs I am formulating a strong opinion about one over the other and that is…don't.  They are different and they are used for completely different purposes so what sense does it make to compare JavaScript functions vs Ruby methods?  Or that is takes procs, blocks, and lambdas to create the “functionality” of a JavaScript function.  You learn them both, and as you add more languages to your arsenal you might waste time wishing for some easier way to iterate in JavaScript or scratching your head over which class method is best for your job, but just don’t.  But since you are wondering one of the more interesting differences I have noticed is hash tables... they don’t behave nor are they called that  in JavaScript. Javascript has something called an “object literal”.  Looks like a hash, even acts like a hash in a way but looks can be deceiving. I consider a hash in Ruby to be a container of key/value “elements” that you retrieve and use when you need to.  Javascript’s “object literals” act like hashes but are not tracked like indexed based associated arrays so if you tried to reference the length of a property you would get ‘undefined’ - that is because in Javascript the length property of an object is not incremented when a new properties(keys) are added(so not like a hash table).
