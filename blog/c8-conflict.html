    <h2 id="conflict">Conflicts</h2>
    <h4>June 21, 2015</h4>
    <p>
      I am faced with conflicts everyday.  From the moment I wake up and walk around the house (I live with slobs), to driving to work (people cutting me off) to determining best method to tackle a particular job.  Conflicts to me are as natural as breathing and are inherent in humans and when I remember that it takes the emotion out of the situation. I see conflicts arise when one person does/likes something one way and the other person does/likes something a different way.  The daily "conflicts" might not have much emotional investment at that moment but they are filed into a "class variable" to be possibly used as ammunition should the emotional investment ever reach a level of importance. <br><br>

 A recent conflict arouse for me when my brother felt he had had enough suffering through the dying process of metastasized tumors in his lungs, he wanted to take an over dose and go out on his own terms.  His two children and I felt it was his choice and would respect any decision he had regarding how he wanted to exit this world.  His wife felt differently and because of the extreme emotional investment for everybody in this situation the "fight or flight" instinct was fight...fight for each of our beliefs, fight to win the other person over to our logic. For his boys is was hot anger...for me, I understand we all are entitled to our opinions and we should be able to express them.  I needed his wife to understand my view so we all got together and expressed our views but we all knew these views were immutable and we all had to "agree" to "disagree" without prejudice.  A lot easier said then done for such an emotional subject but I am closer today with my sister-in-law then my blood sister because of it. <br><br>

Conflicts that are not discussed early only increase the emotions of "fight or flight" so if I feel  I am harboring resentments I am quick to have a conversation regarding the issue.  I feel that at the least I will gain insight into how the other person thinks and hopefully there might be a natural solution in this exchange views.
