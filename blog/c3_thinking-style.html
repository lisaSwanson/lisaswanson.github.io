    <h2 id="#">What Kind of Thinker am I?</h2>
    <h4>May 17, 2015</h4>
    <p>
      I have recently been asked to look at a couple of “thinking” approaches.  One of them is a "growth vs fixed mindset" and as I was reading a couple of articles on subject I immediately felt I was of the growth mindset.  I know I don't fit anywhere in to the fixed mindset but as I was reading more about the growth mindset I knew that is me but I also know I need to lighten up about how I interpret my “failures".  I feel I can learn anything and do anything but I grew up with success being measured by the pay check you bring home, and in that area I have never succeeded to the level of expectations of the people I am close with.  The other thinking/mind style is proposed by Anthony Gregorc  and when I took his quiz the feedback I received was that I was a Concrete Random thinker.  As with most things in life you have pros and cons and I look forward to working though any of the cons I think will prevent me from achieving my goals.  Also what is different for me at my age is...I just don’t need to “hold on” to a certain identity. I feel like I can ebb and flow as needed to work with, and produce with, those around me while I am on this journey to become a Jr. Programmer.
