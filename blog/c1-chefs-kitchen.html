      As I am rushing to complete my first remote week at DevBootCamp my last challenge was to watch a Fireside Chat with Shereef.  It hit me hard emotionally because this week has left me feeling inadequate. I have never look at education as something someone has to spoon feed to me. I know that I am in the drivers seat to and it is up to me to get the most from this expirence and after listening to Shereef I know I am in the right place. I am a kitchen. I look forward to banding with my cohorts and teaches to get and giving the most during our onsite 9 weeks. I feel I will fit into the culture of DevBootCamp. I look forward to becoming a "mad scientist". I am also a bit nervous...I am introvert and this is exaserbated by a lack of confidence...:9).  I will push past this and keep the "kitchen vision" in my head! Let's do this Grasshoppers!
