    <h2 id="#">Using the “group_by” Method in Ruby</h2>
    <h4>May 24, 2015</h4>
    <p>


The group_by method in Ruby, is a method that belongs to the enumerable module.  Unlike a class in Ruby a module provides access to the methods  across multiple classes.  Let me show you...take the follow array<br><br>

<p><b>array=[1, 4, 6, 7, 3, 8, 2, 9, 5, 7, 3, 2, 1, 0, 4] </b></p>

and you are tasked with returning the array with the common elements next to each other. No problem your thinking, I will use Array#sort like this:

<p><b>>>sorted_array = array.sort<br>
=>[0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9]</b></p>

and you would be done - easy peasy…wait there was another part to the challenge…you also need to “sort” another array that looks like this :
<p><b>>>array = [1, 4, 6, 7, 3, "blue", 8, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 4, "green", 7, "yellow", 9, "blue", "green", 5, "yellow"]</b></p>

you think no problem…execute “sort”

<p><b>>>sorted_array = array.sort<br>
=>`sort': comparison of Fixnum with String failed (ArgumentError)</b></p>

Oops,you can’t use method “sort”(which belongs to the Array class) on mixed a element array. Enter…”group_by" and the “mixin” module that will allow you to “sort_of” sort a mixed element "container". When we “group_by" our array with the following syntax:

<p><b>>>array.group_by{|sort| sort}</b></p>

we will be returned a hash that looks like this:

<p><b>=>{1=>[1, 1], 4=>[4, 4], 6=>[6], 7=>[7, 7], 3=>[3, 3], 8=>[8], 2=>[2, 2], 9=>[9], 5=>[5], 0=>[0], "blue"=>[“blue”, “ blue”], "green"=>["green", "green"], "yellow"=>["yellow", "yellow"]}</b></p>

No it isn’t as pretty as Array#sort but it is the beginning step to get the results you desire but lets keep going. Now our hash class is now available so lets fetch just our strings from the hash with this example:

<p><b>>>my_arr = my_array.group_by{|name| name.is_a? String}.fetch(true).sort</b></p>

We will need to apply the sort and the end of this “chain” but that is ok because we no longer have a mixed element container.

<p><b>["blue", "blue", "green", "green", "yellow", "yellow”]</b></p>

Thanks for following along while we learn this Ruby language together.
