    <h2 id="#">Using Array's and Hashes</h2>
    <h4>May 17, 2015</h4>
    <p>
      As newbie programmers we begin our first look at arrays and hashes and ask ourselves when do we use them.  Being a very visual person I see arrays and hashes as expandable containers that I can put anything I want inside them.  These containers differ in that the array container is wide open but the hash container has a divider so there are two compartments.  One side has a label that says “key” and the other says “value”.   You are probably beginning to wonder why you would we want to use one over the other and I will try to just give you enough information to get you curious enough to want to delve deeper into the “why”.  Arrays - they are just great for storage and in ruby you can throw and ton of “objects” in one like String, numbers, Fixnum, Hash, Symbol, even other arrays.  Hashes, to me, are similar to databases - let’s say you are filling out a form that asks you for your name, address, etc. as you are filling in the boxes that information could be stored in a hash using “name” as a key and what you enter as a value and then saved and retrieved using the key/value pair. Arrays and hashes are the work horses in programming and I look forward to learning how to get the most from them.
