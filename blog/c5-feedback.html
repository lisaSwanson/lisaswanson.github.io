    <h2 id="#">Pairing and Giving Feedback</h2>
    <h4>Today's Date</h4>
    <p>
      I know I am not alone when I say that pairing sessions are completely new to me.  I have social anxiety to start and add the whole video format, coupled with all the new programs we are using, github, screenhero, sublime, CL, etc. and wow I am a bag of nerves. Wait I forgot the most fearful part of all…not feeling that my skills (or lack there of) are worth sharing with anybody.  Pairing really makes me feel vulnerable because you can’t hide if you don't know something you just have to let your partner know - but pairing is really awesome.  I will gladly work through all of those fears and vulnerabilities to be able to meet new people who love this field we are embracing.  Every pairing session I have had help me get better skills.
