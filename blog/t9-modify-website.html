  <h1>Website Modification</h1>
  <h4>June 28, 2015</h4>
  <p>Every week I go to website and publish a new blog for the week and when I get to my site I always say \”yuck\”.  At the time I was proud of my effort because I was working my business more then doing the homework necessary to actually execute my work in a timely manner but not now.  So I did welcome this challenge but I also know that this is a time consuming proposal so I tackled it like this…<br><br>I used a template from the Jon Duckett book and when from there.  Did this help or hurt.  I will say this…at this point it is all a learning experience and it helped me understand what I don’t like.  After learning a little bit about atomic styling and using a grid template - that is what I will do in the future. I did want to spend more time learning about jQuery so the time saved by getting a head start with the HTML was great.  It was also interesting to modify the CSS to see how things were changing - seeing if I knew exactly what would change before the refresh.<br><br>I like my site for now.  I couldn’t get the functionality of my jQuery to operate the way I would like so \”site maintenance\” is in my very near future.</p>
