      One of the most popular social networking sites out there, that you have never heard about, is call github.com.  It is a social networking site for software developers and as a burgeoning software developer yourself this is a great site to utilize as your career launches.

        Why, you ask...code, code, and more code.  It's a smorgasbord of code that you can fork, (this is your teaser to want to go and check it out)modify and use to your hearts content. But the best feature of GitHub would be it's ability to track versions of your code with it's handy mate "git".  Git is software that you download on your local machine and that is when the real magic happens. As you develop your awesome project and your developer friends want to help to further your project along.  Git tracks all your friends or colleges changes and allows you to review and utilize them to your "master" project as you like.  This is call version control and if you don't want to tear out your hair it is truly the only way to manage any software project.
