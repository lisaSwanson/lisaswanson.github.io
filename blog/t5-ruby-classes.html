    <h2 id="rubyclass">Ruby - When, Why, and How to Use Classes</h2>
    <h4>May 31, 2015</h4>
    <p>


As a beginner to programming in general Ruby is my first language so I can only say that trying to explain to when, why, and how to use classes in Ruby will be rudimentary - so apologies to those not at this newbie level.
<br><br>

Classes as I see them are like a blue print, I know everyone say that, but its true.  1000 of Ruby programmers are out there writing similar code and a class to me is like a shell of functionality or like the blueprints of a suburban track house, lots of core structure that you can then modify to customize your “build”.  Classes in ruby are used all the time and you/I will also use them all the time.  Classes are our structures that will hold our methods that we write.  Classes already hold lots of the methods that you use for the most basic of Ruby programs so learn about them, love them, and call an instance of one...ClassBlog.new :-)
