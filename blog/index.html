      <img src="../imgs/box_model.gif" alt="box" width="300" height="150">Moving elements around an HTML page to achieve your design is mandatory and knowing difference between margins, borders and padding is a great tool to have.  Lets take it from the inside out (use the image as a reference)...padding is what you would change if you had a "border" and you wanted to place your content a certain distance from it.  Use a border to accentuate your content and last, but not least, is "margin" and that is the space outside of the border.  Happy coding...

    <h2 id="why_git">Why You Should Consider Using GitHub</h2>
    <h4>Sunday, May 3, 2015</h4>

    One of the most popular social networking sites out there, that you have never heard about, is call github.com.  It is a social networking site for software developers and as a burgeoning software developer yourself this is a great site to utilize as your career launches.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why, you ask...code, code, and more code.  It's a smorgasbord of code that you can fork, (this is your teaser to want to go and check it out)modify and use to your hearts content. But the best feature of GitHub would be it's ability to track versions of your code with it's handy mate "git".  Git is software that you download on your local machine and that is when the real magic happens. As you develop your awesome project and your developer friends want to help to further your project along.  Git tracks all your friends or colleges changes and allows you to review and utilize them to your "master" project as you like.  This is call version control and if you don't want to tear out your hair it is truly the only way to manage any software project.

      As I am rushing to complete my first remote week at DevBootCamp my last challenge was to watch a Fireside Chat with Shereef.  It hit me hard emotionally because this week has left me feeling inadequate. I have never look at education as something someone has to spoon feed to me. I know that I am in the drivers seat to and it is up to me to get the most from this expirence and after listening to Shereef I know I am in the right place. I am a kitchen. I look forward to banding with my cohorts and teaches to get and giving the most during our onsite 9 weeks. I feel I will fit into the culture of DevBootCamp. I look forward to becoming a "mad scientist". I am also a bit nervous...I am introvert and this is exaserbated by a lack of confidence...:9).  I will push past this and keep the "kitchen vision" in my head! Let's do this Grasshoppers!
