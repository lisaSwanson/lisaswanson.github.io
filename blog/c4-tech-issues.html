    <h2 id="#">Why Women are Leaving the Tech Industry</h2>
    <h4>May 24, 2015</h4>
    <p>Below is my personal reflection after reading and watching the interview at this link:<br>

    http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-gardner-women-in-tech-20141207-story.html<br>

    Image my chagrin when I read that line…here I am, a women at 52, changing careers to the technology industry for the very reason I am wanting to leave my current career.  I am (as I have said before) a women electrical contractor/electrician.  It has been an up hill battle trying to get “in” with a decent general contractor.  In my 3 years running my own company, I finally did find a “crazy” but decent general contractor and without “him” feeding me the “big jobs” I wouldn’t have been able to pay my bills.

    What is the over arching reason that women are leaving the tech industry…gender bias (read the article for the details).  At first, I felt “hey it’s a job, doing what you love, I know it’s not fair but what is in this thing called life”,  but after hearing the stories of inequality I feel differently.  Yes I do think is wrong that women are leaving the industry because if we “leave” that is as good as failing.  We can’t affect change but getting “beaten down” by the fact that “gender bias” exists and will keep existing unless we stay strong and in the industry.  We will never have our “Martin Luther King” moment if we don’t.  BUT, as with any group that is feeling inequality we need to have resources that provide us with the strength to stay motivated.  One of those that was mentioned in the article is a group called “Women Who Code”.  If you are a women and you are feeling the pressure of gender bias try to find an outlet to release that pressure.  I know that doesn’t make change but it helps get your sanity.  Hopefully if more women stay, over time, more women will be become managers/veeps that can manage without the gender bias.
