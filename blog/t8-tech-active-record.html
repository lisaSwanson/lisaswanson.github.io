      ActiveRecord is magic to those who use the web application development framework Rails. Rails in written in the Ruby language which is the magic behind ActiveRecord. Let's demystify the magic behind ActiveRecord.  ActiveRecord wraps your tables in classes so that instances of these classes become the rows in the database. These instances allow mapping between classes and tables, attributes and columns. It also gives associations between objects defined by simple class methods.<br><br> ActiveRecord uses SQL to query the database and provides your instance of ActiveRecord with the data you need to CRUD. Every ActiveRecord object stores the values for its attributes in a private instance variable called @attributes which is a hash of the names and the values of the database attributes. ActiveRecord also adds methods for accessing each attribute. ActiveRecord seems like magic because all the heavy lifting of creating, reading, updating or deleting (CRUD) has already been developed in the many class methods utilized during an ActiveRecord session. <br><br>As I write this blog I haven't yet used Rails and have only written a handful of Ruby methods but I already can appreciated the functionality of ActiveRecord and I look forward to learning more.
